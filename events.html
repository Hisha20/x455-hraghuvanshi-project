          Our regular tea on its own is amazingly refreshing, but when it is
          brewed with fresh spices & herbs – they take its magic to another
          level. So, these are the 5 most popular flavors that give garam Chai a
          unique appeal.
          <br />
          1. Spices [Masala]
          <br />
          Spices such as Clove, Black Pepper, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Tulsi, and
          Saunth – are used to give the tea a distinct flavor. They are added in
          precise quantities and powdered before using. At Tea Post, we use our
          own signature Masala Blend to create a consistent Masala Chai
          experience.
          <br />
          2. Ginger [Adrak]
          <br />
          Fresh Ginger is one of the most common ingredients used for flavored
          Chai because it is easily available throughout the country. It is cut
          into small pieces, crushed in mortar & pestle, and added to the
          brewing pot while making tea.
          <br />
          3. Mint [Pudina]
          <br />
          Mint Leaves are added while making the tea, and they are also used to
          garnish the cup of tea while serving. Mint leaves give a very cool &
          refreshing flavor to the tea, and it is usually mixed with other
          spices & herbs to create a unique texture.
          <br />
          4. Cardamom [Elaichi]
          <br />
          Elaichi Pods are used as a whole, and they are crushed in mortar &
          pestle before adding to the brewing teapot. The covers of cardamom
          pods are filtered out using a sieve. Elaichi gives Chai a mildly
          fruity and dreamy flavor that brings you in good mood instantly.
          <br />
          5. Saffron [Kesar]
          <br />
          Kesar is one of the most costly spices in the world. It is sourced
          from authentic Saffron cultivators in Jammu & Kashmir. Even in minute
          quantities, Kesar creates an amazing taste and aroma that linger on
          for a long time. Every sip of Kesar Tea is worth its price.
          <br />
          At Tea Post, you can try more than 15 varieties of Chai – including
          both Iced Tea & Hot Tea. You can also opt for a sugar-free chai – if
          you want to control your sugar levels. Also, you can try our Green
          Tea, Black Tea, and immunity-boosting Kava Chai to experience how
          flavors make your cup of tea magical

          Two simple incidents made such a huge impact on humanity that after so
          many centuries, we can still feel them.
          <br />
          The most popular incident of the two – An apple fell from a tree and
          Sir Isaac Newton discovered THE THEORY OF GRAVITY. And the other – not
          so popular incident – a few leaves from nearby bushes flew into his
          pot of boiling water and Chinese emperor Shen Nung discovered a new
          BEVERAGE CALLED TEA!
          <br />
          Even today, we calculate the force of gravity to execute complex
          engineering tasks. And every day, with the help of a cup of Chai,
          millions of people elevate their moods and feel refreshed.
          <br />
          Since the times of Shen Nung, our beloved Chai has been through a
          breathtaking 5000 years long journey.
          <br />
          During the fourth century, the Tsang dynasty established and expanded
          the tea industry in areas covering the interior of Southern China to
          the border of today’s Assam. There were many indigenous tea species
          growing in the wild and small tea gardens were also being cultivated
          in India during the 1780s. The indigenous tea plants in Assam were
          discovered in 1788 by Sir Joseph Bank, in Coochbehar of Bengal.
          <br />
          It is believed that in the year 1606, the first consignment of tea
          reached the trading base of Dutch merchants at Benton. This was the
          first time that the western world experienced the magic of Chai.
          <br />
          In India, the large-scale production of tea began after the 1820s when
          the British East India Company established tea gardens in Assam. After
          that, the tea industry expanded rapidly to other parts of India and
          Sri Lanka, wherever the geographical & climatic conditions were
          favorable.
          <br />
          Today, tea is cultivated in about 16 Indian states, and 96% of the
          total tea production in India is done in 4 states – Assam, West
          Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala.
          <br />
          It is so amazing how centuries of hard work in the tea gardens and in
          the global markets – created an ecosystem that made CHAI the world’s
          most consumed drink, after water.
